    <p>
        A country with a rich and colourful history, India is home to some of the world's most fascinating cultures. India is a country located in South Asia and the capital of India is New Delhi. The Government of India, the Constitutional Republic represents a highly diverse population of thousands of ethnic groups and the many languages spoken in the country.
        According to the Population Reference Bureau (PRB), it has a population of over 1.2 billion, making it the second-most populous country in the world. Built-in approximately 9,000 years ago, India was largely self-contained and became a cultural arena associated with Hinduism. The roots of this tradition can be traced to the Indus civilization.
        Other religions such as Buddhism and Jainism originated in India, where Buddhism spread throughout Asia, while both religions are quite popular in the subcontinent. India has also developed a rich intellectual life in such fields as astronomy, fine art, architecture, mathematics, and music.
        The country has been recognized for its economic development since gaining independence in 1947. It has become the seventh-largest country in the world, and it is geographically distinct from other Asian nations because of its location between mountains and the sea. India is a country of many contrasts, from the Indian Ocean to snow-capped peaks and the deserts in Rajasthan to the green forests of Kerala.

    <h3>1. Red Fort: A symbol of splendour</h3>
    <img src = "redfort.jpg" width = "40%" height = "50%"/>
    <h3>About Red Fort in brief.</h3>
    <p>Lying at the heart of Delhi, the majestic <b>Red Fort</b> stands as a testament to the architectural legacy of Mughals. This UNESCO World Heritage Site is built from fine red sandstone, and also famous as Qila-e-Mubaraq, is replete with beautiful palaces, pavilions and mosques. Built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as the palace fort of his capital Shahjahanabad, the Red Fort is famous for its massive enclosing walls. The fort's construction was completed over a span of ten years, between 1638 and 1648. The Red Fort’s innovative planning and brilliant architecture has inspired a number of monuments in Rajasthan, Delhi and Agra. 
       A visit to the historic fort makes for a quintessential Old Delhi experience and offers tourists a chance to appreciate the grandeur of a bygone era. The Red Fort once overlooked the Yamuna River, which has shrunk over the course of time. Historians also suggest that a tree-lined waterway, which was called Nehr-e-Bihisht or river of paradise, ran out of the fort and its flow was sourced from River Yamuna. The architecture of the Red Fort reflects a seamless fusion of Islamic, Persian, Timurid and Hindu styles.
       Diwan-e-Khas, also known as the Shah Mahal, the Diwan-e-Aam or the Hall of Public Audience (shown here) and the Rang Mahal, also known as the Imtiyaz Mahal, are major attractions.</p>
    
    <h3>2. Taj Mahal : The White Marble wonder of world</h3>
    <img src = "tajmahal.jpg" width ="40%"/> <img src = "tajmahal2.jpg" width ="35.5%"/>
    <h3>About Taj Mahal in brief.</h3>
    <p>The <b>Taj Mahal</b> is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.
       Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.
       The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage”. It is regarded by many as the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts 7-8 million visitors a year. In 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000-2007) initiative.

    <h3>7. Darjeeling : Coolest place in west Bengal</h3>
    <img src ="darjeeling.jpg" width = "40%"/>
    <h3>About Darjeeling in brief.</h3>
    <p><b>Darjeeling</b> is a city in the northernmost region of the Indian state of West Bengal. Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it has an average elevation of 2,045 metres (6,709 ft).[10] To the west of Darjeeling lies the easternmost province of Nepal, to the east the Kingdom of Bhutan, to the north the Indian state of Sikkim, and farther north the Tibet Autonomous Region region of China. Bangladesh lies to the south and southeast, and most of the state of West Bengal lies to the south and southwest, connected to the Darjeeling region by a narrow tract. 
       Kangchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, rises to the north and is prominently visible on clear days. In the early 19th century, during East India Company rule in India, Darjeeling was identified as a potential summer retreat for British officials, soldiers and their families. The narrow mountain ridge was leased from the Kingdom of Sikkim, and eventually annexed to British India. Experimentation with growing tea on the slopes below Darjeeling was highly successful. Thousands of labourers were recruited chiefly from Nepal to clear the 
       forests, build European-style cottages and work in the tea plantations. The widespread deforestation displaced the indigenous peoples. Residential schools were established in and around Darjeeling for the education of children of the domiciled British in India. By the late-19th century, a novel narrow-gauge mountain railway, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, was bringing summer residents into the town and carrying a freight of tea out for export to the world. After India's independence in 1947, as the British left Darjeeling, its cottages were 
       purchased by wealthy Indians from the plains and its tea plantations by out-of-town Indian business owners and conglomerates.</p>

Located on a 15-km-long horseshoe ridge with the grand Himalayas as a backdrop, 
       Mussoorie spreads across at a height of 2,000 m above sea level. From this vantage point, it offers scenic views of Himalayas peaks in Western Garhwal.
